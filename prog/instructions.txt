to create a list function:
-first create a prepared statement:
--define the query inside StatementStrings.cs
--define name as private in DbContext

-define function inside DbContext

-Go to controller, create the function that will be seen by the view

-go to ListCommands (for operations other than List, create another class) and handle it there


To query fast in program.cs:
        using var ttmm = PreparedStatement.Create(dbContext.DbConnection,"SELECT * FROM salary").ExecuteReader();
        while (ttmm.Read())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ttmm.GetInt32(ttmm.GetOrdinal("salary_amount")));
        }



to create new model:
-write the types and atttributes
-make it geenrate IEquatable
-Write toString





DTO:
created as records, cannot be changed
between the (), write the attributes that can be fetched from view



stuff:
Make help command better

get_cost is not in help

update_student_number also not in help. also the input should be switched (first instance then number)

putting a wrong instance in update_student_number error should be fixed

When an update is succesful we should return "allocation cmplete" or smthn

add a list for all course instances

in activity create , if you give an existing teaching activity it will give sql error
