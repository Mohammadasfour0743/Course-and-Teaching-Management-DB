to create a list function:
-first create a prepared statement:
--define the query inside StatementStrings.cs
--define name as private in DbContext

-define function inside DbContext

-Go to controller, create the function that will be seen by the view

-go to ListCommands (for operations other than List, create another class) and handle it there


To query fast in program.cs:
        using var ttmm = PreparedStatement.Create(dbContext.DbConnection,"SELECT * FROM salary").ExecuteReader();
        while (ttmm.Read())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ttmm.GetInt32(ttmm.GetOrdinal("salary_amount")));
        }



to create new model:
-write the types and atttributes
-make it geenrate IEquatable
-Write toString





DTO:
created as records, cannot be changed
between the (), write the attributes that can be fetched from view

Note for report: added ALTER TABLE planned_activity
                       ADD CONSTRAINT unique_activity_per_course
                       UNIQUE (course_instance_id, teaching_activity_id);


stuff to consider:
-get_cost: inputs: course_instance.
can throw an error if wrong instance is given.  Handled

-update_student_number: inputs: course_instance, student number.
can throw an error if wrong course instance is given. Handled
sql error (see below)

-teacher_allocation: input: 
--list (first name, last name)
error if name is incorrect. Handled

--allocate (first, last, course instance, activity name, hours)
error if name is incorrect
error if course instance does not exist
error if activity is not planned in course
error if activity name is typed incorrect
error if hours <0 handled

--deallocate (first, last, course instance, activity name)
error if name is incorrect
error if course instance does not exist
error if activity is not planned in course
error if deleting an allocation that does not exist handled


-activity: input:
--create (activity name, factor)
sql error (see below). handled

--assign (course_instance, activity name, planned hours)
planned hours can be negative handled
sql errors (see below)

--list (course instance)
error if input is wrong. Handled

SQL ERRORS:

-update_student_number: P0001 (also trigger)
making number of students > max allowed handled


-teacher_allocation allocate: P0001 (thrown by trigger)
allocating more than 4 instances to one teacher 
to test: teacher_allocation allocate Maria Lindgren 2025-DH2100-f5c9 Lecture 4 (replace course instance with your own, but it should be for DH2100) handled

-teacher_allocation allocate: 23505 (unique)
allocating something that already exists (if Helena has Lecture in course X, you cannot allocate Lecture in X)
(i think if they want to allocate more, they can delete the existing one and allocate a new one. easier to handle) handled


-activity create: 23305 (unique)
creating an existing activity. handled

-activity assign: 23505 (unique)
assigning an activity that already exists (if course X has lecture hours, you cannot assign lecture hours to it again)

-activity assign: 23502 (not null)
if one of the inputs is wrong, the SELECT in the query cannot find the corresponding stuff, and will throw this error.
(provide a wrong course instance or activity name
handled
